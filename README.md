# Wikipedia Previews

Wikipedia previews allows you to provide context from Wikipedia about words or phrases on any website. It lets you show a popup card with a short summary from Wikipedia when a reader hovers over a link.

## Built with

It is a small Javascript component that does not have any dependencies and should be compatible with most browsers.

## Features

* Works with any link that has an article on Wikipedia
* Works for LTR languages
* Works for articles with or without a lead image

## Getting Started

### Standalone Script

```html
<script src="wikipedia-previews.production.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  wikipediaPreviews.init()
</script>
```
You can serve the file yourself or include it from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/wikipedia-previews@1.0.0/dist/wikipedia-previews.production.js).

### NPM
```bash
$ npm install wikipedia-previews --save
```

```javascript
const wikipediaPreviews = require('wikipedia-previews')
wikipediaPreviews.init()
```

### Options of the init function

The `init` function accepts the following options:

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
root | DOM Element | `document` | Where to look for elements that should have the popup
selector | string | `'[data-wikipedia-preview]'` | How nodes that should have the popup are identified
lang | string | `'en'` | Default Wikipedia language
popupContainer | DOM Element | `document.body` | Where to put the popup in the DOM

Example
```html
<p class="content">
	You can learn about <span class="wiki">Chat</span> and <span class="wiki">Chien</span> from Wikipedia.
</p>
<div class="popup-container"></div>
```

```javascript
wikipediaPreviews.init({
	root: document.querySelector('.content'),
	selector: '.wiki',
	popupContainer: '.popup-container',
	lang: 'fr'
});
```

### Attributes

#### data-wikipedia-preview

To indicate that a word or expression should bring up the article preview popup, mark it with the `data-wikipedia-preview` attribute (or anything else as long as you're using the `selector` option described above).

By default, nodes with the `data-wikipedia-preview` attribute don't have any special visual treatment. You should style them in a way that makes sense for your context.

Example

```css
[data-wikipedia-preview] {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```

#### data-wp-title

When the article title is not the same as the node's `textContent` property, use the `data-wp-title` attribute to specify the article title.

#### data-wp-lang

To use a language different than the language specified in the options, use the `data-wp-lang` attribute.
